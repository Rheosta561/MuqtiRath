**MuqtiRath** is an initiative to **bridge the gap between women trapped in prostitution and the NGOs** that can help them. Often, women in brothels are unaware of where to turn for assistance. *MuqtiRath* is here to **connect, empower, and uplift**.

Through this platform, women can:
- Connect discreetly with NGOs for support.
- Access upskilling programs.
- Explore dignified employment opportunities.
- Take the first steps toward freedom and self-reliance.

> 🌟 **Special Mention** at Microsoft Gurgaon and IGDTUW Delhi.
